### [Full range of infinite point blow-up exponents for the critical generalized KdV equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13538v1)
*Published: 2025-11-17*  
**Authors:** Nailya Manatova

For the quintic, mass critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, for any $ν\in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$, we prove the existence of solutions in the energy space that blow up in finite time $T>0$ with the blow-up rate $\|\partial_x u(t)\|_{L^2} \sim (T-t)^{-ν}$ (infinite point blow-up). These solutions are constructed arbitrarily close to the family of solitons and correspond to the concentration of...

### [Effective equidistribution of random walks on simple homogeneous spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13512v1)
*Published: 2025-11-17*  
**Authors:** Timothée Bénard, Weikun He

We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/Λ$ where $G$ is a non-compact simple Lie group and $Λ$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $μ$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that the random walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure unless it is trapped in a finite $μ$-invariant set. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(...

### [Stable Self- Similar Blow- Up In Nonlinear Wave Equations With Quadratic Time-Derivative Nonlinearities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13504v1)
*Published: 2025-11-17*  
**Authors:** Faiq Raees, Jie Liu

We study singularity formation in two one-dimensional nonlinear wave models with quadratic time-derivative nonlinearities.

### [Rankwidth of Graphs with Balanced Separations: Expansion for Dense Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13528v1)
*Published: 2025-11-17*  
**Authors:** Emile Anand

We prove that every graph of rankwidth at least $72r$ contains an induced subgraph whose minimum balanced cutrank is at least $r$, which implies a vertex subset where every balanced separation has $\mathbb{F}_2$-cutrank at least $r$. This implies a novel relation between rankwidth and a well-linkedness measure, defined entirely by balanced vertex cuts. As a byproduct, our result supports the notio...
