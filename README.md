### [$CPT$-Symmetric Kähler-Dirac Fermions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11548v1)
*Published: 2025-11-14*  
**Authors:** Latham Boyle, Wei-Ning Deng

Kähler-Dirac (KD) spinors have generated excitement in the lattice gauge theory community, as a way to (i) deal with the ``fermion doubling" problems that plague ordinary (Dirac, Majorana, or Weyl) spinors when discretized on a lattice, and (ii) help explain the structure of the standard model. But if one naively quantizes this theory in Lorentzian signature, problems arise: half the KD fields hav...

### [The Number of Solvabilizers in Finite Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11544v1)
*Published: 2025-11-14*  
**Authors:** Banafsheh Akbari, Ethan Han, Sasha Lin, Benjamin Vakil

Considering a finite group $G$, for any element $x\in G$, the solvabilizer of $x$ in $G$ is defined as $Sol_G(x)=\{y \in G : \langle x, y \rangle \text{ is solvable}\}$. In this paper, we introduce $Solv(G)$ as the number of distinct solvabilizers of elements in $G$. A group is called $n$-solvabilizer if $|Solv(G)|=n$. We compute $|Solv(G)|$ for various classes of non-abelian simple groups, includ...

*Published: 2025-11-14*  
**Authors:** Claudio Altafini

In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head''...
