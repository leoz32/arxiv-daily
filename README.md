### [The Informed Sampler: A Discriminative Approach to Bayesian Inference in Generative Computer Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0859v3)
*Published: 2014-02-04*  
**Authors:** Varun Jampani, Sebastian Nowozin, Matthew Loper, Peter V. Gehler

Computer vision is hard because of a large variability in lighting, shape, and texture; in addition the image signal is non-additive due to occlusion. Generative models promised to account for this variability by accurately modelling the image formation process as a function of latent variables with prior beliefs. Bayesian posterior inference could then, in principle, explain the observation. Whil...
