*Published: 2025-11-07*  
**Authors:** Sascha Gehrmann, Fabian H. L. Essler

We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries and induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally, we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the ma...

### [Algebraic hyperbolicity of subvarieties of homogeneous varieties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05488v1)
*Published: 2025-11-07*  
**Authors:** Andy B. Day, Neelarnab Raha

We study the algebraic hyperbolicity of certain subvarieties of homogeneous varieties, building on the techniques introduced by Coskun-Riedl, Yeong and Mioranci. This generalizes earlier known results for hypersurfaces to higher codimensions. In particular, we observe that if $X=X_1\cap\cdots\cap X_k$ is a very general complete intersection of degree $d_j$ hypersurfaces $X_j$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ wit...

We revisit the stochastic, or noise, contributions to the galaxy density field within the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure. Starting from the general, all-order expression of the EFT partition function, we elucidate how the stochastic contributions can be described by local nonlinear couplings of a single Gaussian noise field. We introduce an alternative formulation of the par...

### [SoilX: Calibration-Free Comprehensive Soil Sensing Through Contrastive Cross-Component Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05482v1)

Simulation of stabilizer circuits is a well-studied problem in quantum information processing, with a number of highly optimized algorithms available. Yet, we argue that further improvements can arise from the theoretical structure of stabilizer operations themselves. We focus on the subclass of stabilizer circuits composed of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)-preserving stabilizer operations, which na...

*Published: 2025-11-07*  
**Authors:** Natalia Gherghel, Hari K. Kunduri

We investigate the stability of homogeneous minimal submanifolds in two families of closed Einstein manifolds, the Page space $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ and the Sasaki-Einstein spaces $Y^{p,q}$, which are equipped with cohomogeneity-one Einstein metrics admitting the isometric action of $SU(2) \times U(1)$ and $U(1) \times U(1) \times SU(2)$ respectively. We determine all the homo...

### [On Flow Matching KL Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05480v1)
*Published: 2025-11-07*  
**Authors:** Maojiang Su, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Sophia Pi, Han Liu

We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular, if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$ depend...
