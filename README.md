**Authors:** Jingxi Chen, Zongxia Li, Zhichao Liu, Guangyao Shi, Xiyang Wu, Fuxiao Liu, Cornelia Fermuller, Brandon Y. Feng, Yiannis Aloimonos

What role does the first frame play in video generation models? Traditionally, it's viewed as the spatial-temporal starting point of a video, merely a seed for subsequent animation. In this work, we reveal a fundamentally different perspective: video models implicitly treat the first frame as a conceptual memory buffer that stores visual entities for later reuse during generation. Leveraging this ...

We present an experimental and theoretical study of the anisotropic pyrochlore phase diagram. Inelastic field-dependent neutron scattering on Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ shows intrinsic broadening and a flat low-energy magnon mode which is partially captured by interacting magnon models. Exact diagonalization reveals the existence of an emergent quantum phase between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, i...

### [Nonlinear scalar field equations with a critical Hardy potential](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15668v1)
*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Bartosz Bieganowski, Daniel Strzelecki

We study the existence of solutions for the nonlinear scalar field equation $$-Δu - \frac{(N-2)^2}{4|x|^2} u = g(u), \quad \mbox{in } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \{0\},$$ where the potential $-\frac{(N-2)^2}{4|x|^2}$ is the critical Hardy potential and $N \geq 3$. The nonlinearity $g$ is continuous and satisfies general subcritical growth assumptions of the Berestycki-Lions type. The problem is approac...

### [Localizing AlAdS$_5$ black holes and the SUSY index on $S^1 \times M_3$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15666v1)
*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Jaeha Park

We consider complex, supersymmetric, non-extremal Euclidean black holes that are asymptotically locally AdS$_5$, with $S^1 \times M_3$ conformal boundary. We study field theory backgrounds consisting of various $M_3$, and explicitly construct Killing spinors that are anti-periodic around the Euclidean time circle. Focussing on elliptically/biaxially squashed three-spheres and Lens spaces, we compu...

### [Quantum-Guided Test Case Minimization for LLM-Based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15665v1)

Precisely controlling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate efficient and concise code is a central challenge in software engineering. We introduce a framework based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) that transforms code specification into a combinatorial optimization task. The framework first prompts an LLM to generate a test suite, then formulates the Test Case Minimization (TCM) problem as a ...

### [Exponential Suppression of Transport in Electric Quantum Walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15664v1)
*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Houssam Abdul-Rahman, Christopher Cedzich, Günter Stolz, Albert H. Werner

We establish exact scalings for the maximal group velocity of translation-invariant quantum walks in periodic electric fields. Our main result shows that the maximal group velocity decays exponentially with the period of the field in the whole parameter range, thus affirming a conjecture of arXiv:2302.01869 and at the same time augmenting it to an exact equality. We further demonstrate explicit re...

### [Generalized Borel Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15663v1)
*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Claudio Agostini, Nick Chapman, Luca Motto Ros, Beatrice Pitton

Generalizing classical descriptive set theory opens foundational questions about the Borel hierarchy. In this paper we systematically study those questions, working in the general framework of Polish-like spaces relative to an uncountable cardinal $κ$, possibly singular, satisfying $2^{<κ}=κ$. We provide fundamental properties of the $κ^+$-Borel hierarchy of any regular Hausdorff space of weight a...

### [VisPlay: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models from Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15661v1)
*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Yicheng He, Chengsong Huang, Zongxia Li, Jiaxin Huang, Yonghui Yang

Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve...

### [Fantômas: An analysis of parton distributions in a pion with Bézier parametrizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15657v1)
*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Lucas Kotz, Aurore Courtoy, Pavel Nadolsky, Fredrick Olness, Maximiliano Ponce-Chavez

We systematically explore the parametrization dependence of the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) to better quantify the true uncertainty from global QCD analyses. To achieve this, we employ a novel technique that automates the generation of polynomial parametrizations for PDFs using Bézier curves. This technique is implemented in a C++ module, named Fantômas, which is now included within the x...

### [Material processing by laser-plasma-filament-guided high voltage discharges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15651v1)

### [Tokenisation over Bounded Alphabets is Hard](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15709v1)
*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Violeta Kastreva, Philip Whittington, Dennis Komm, Tiago Pimentel

Recent works have shown that tokenisation is NP-complete. However, these works assume tokenisation is applied to inputs with unboundedly large alphabets -- an unrealistic assumption, given that in practice tokenisers operate over fixed-size alphabets, such as bytes or Unicode characters. We close this gap by analysing tokenisation over bounded $n$-ary alphabets, considering two natural variants: b...

### [RoMa v2: Harder Better Faster Denser Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15706v1)
*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Johan Edstedt, David Nordström, Yushan Zhang, Georg Bökman, Jonathan Astermark, Viktor Larsson, Anders Heyden, Fredrik Kahl, Mårten Wadenbäck, Michael Felsberg

Dense feature matching aims to estimate all correspondences between two images of a 3D scene and has recently been established as the gold-standard due to its high accuracy and robustness. However, existing dense matchers still fail or perform poorly for many hard real-world scenarios, and high-precision models are often slow, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we attack these weaknesses...

### [The Impact of Quantization on Large Reasoning Model Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15694v1)
*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Medha Kumar, Zifei Xu, Xin Wang, Tristan Webb

Strong reasoning capabilities can now be achieved by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without any supervised fine-tuning. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) are well studied in the context of fine-tuning, how quantization impacts RL in large reasoning models (LRMs) remains an open question. To answer this question, we conducted systematic experim...

*Published: 2025-11-19*  
**Authors:** Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Zhihang Yuan, Yifu Ding, Ruihao Gong, Jinyang Guo, Xianglong Liu, Jun Zhang

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks, but they suffer from high computational inefficiency. To reduce inference overhead, expert skipping methods have been proposed to deactivate redundant experts based on the current input tokens. However, we find that applying these methods-originally designed for unimodal large language models (LLMs)-t...
