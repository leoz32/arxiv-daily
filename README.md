**Authors:** Jinliang Liu

Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a rob...

There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically

**Authors:** Tao Tao, Maissam Barkeshli

We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nev...

We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of

Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose

**Authors:** Thomas Gawne, Alina Kononov, Andrew Baczewski, Hannah Bellenbaum, Maximilian P Böhme, Zhandos Moldabekov, Thomas R Preston, Sebastian Schwalbe, Jan Vorberger, Tobias Dornheim

X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) probes the dynamic structure factor of the

**Authors:** Majed El Helou, Chiara Troiani, Benjamin Ryder, Jean Diaconu, Hervé Muyal, Marcelo Yannuzzi

Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization

### [Assessment of the conditional exchangeability assumption in causal machine learning models: a simulation study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26700v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Gerard T. Portela, Jason B. Gibbons, Sebastian Schneeweiss, Rishi J. Desai

Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducte...

### [The End of Manual Decoding: Towards Truly End-to-End Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26697v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Zhichao Wang, Dongyang Ma, Xinting Huang, Deng Cai, Tian Lan, Jiahao Xu, Haitao Mi, Xiaoying Tang, Yan Wang

The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with

Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the
potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are
paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and
handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce

We prove that the displacement group of the dihedral quandle with n elements
is isomorphic to the group generated by rotations of the n/2-gon when n is even
and the n-gon when n is odd. We additionally show that any quandle with at
least one trivial column has equivalent displacement and inner automorphism
groups. Then, using a known enumeration of quandles which we confirm up to

**Authors:** Qianyou Zhao, Yuliang Shen, Xuanran Zhai, Ce Hao, Duidi Wu, Jin Qi, Jie Hu, Qiaojun Yu

In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an...

**Authors:** Georgios Kamaras, Craig Innes, Subramanian Ramamoorthy

In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, pos...

Coupling of electron heat conduction and magnetic field takes significant
effects in inertial confinement fusion (ICF). As the nonlocal models for

### [Tensor decomposition beyond uniqueness, with an application to the minrank problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26587v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Pascal Koiran, Rafael Oliveira

We prove a generalization to Jennrich's uniqueness theorem for tensor
decompositions in the undercomplete setting. Our uniqueness theorem is based on
an alternative definition of the standard tensor decomposition, which we call
matrix-vector decomposition. Moreover, in the same settings in which our
uniqueness theorem applies, we also design and analyze an efficient randomized
algorithm to compute...

### [Stop Wasting Your Tokens: Towards Efficient Runtime Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26585v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Fulin Lin, Shaowen Chen, Ruishan Fang, Hongwei Wang, Tao Lin

While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing
autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,
such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.
Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking
proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To
this end, we introduce Su...

### [Emu3.5: Native Multimodal Models are World Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26583v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Yufeng Cui, Honghao Chen, Haoge Deng, Xu Huang, Xinghang Li, Jirong Liu, Yang Liu, Zhuoyan Luo, Jinsheng Wang, Wenxuan Wang, Yueze Wang, Chengyuan Wang, Fan Zhang, Yingli Zhao, Ting Pan, Xianduo Li, Zecheng Hao, Wenxuan Ma, Zhuo Chen, Yulong Ao, Tiejun Huang, Zhongyuan Wang, Xinlong Wang

We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interle...

### [CATCH: A Modular Cross-domain Adaptive Template with Hook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26582v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Xinjin Li, Yulie Lu, Jinghan Cao, Yu Ma, Zhenglin Li, Yeyang Zhou

Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts an...

### [Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning Using Vision-Language Alignment in Zero-Shot Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26580v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Manjunath Prasad Holenarasipura Rajiv, B. M. Vidyavathi

In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Langu...

### [Inference-Cost-Aware Dynamic Tree Construction for Efficient Inference in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26577v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Yinrong Hong, Zhiquan Tan, Kai Hu

Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the im...

### ["Show Me You Comply... Without Showing Me Anything": Zero-Knowledge Software Auditing for AI-Enabled Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26576v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Filippo Scaramuzza, Renato Cordeiro Ferreira, Tomaz Maia Suller, Giovanni Quattrocchi, Damian Andrew Tamburri, Willem-Jan van den Heuvel

The increasing exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems
in critical domains has made trustworthiness concerns a paramount showstopper,
requiring verifiable accountability, often by regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act).
Classical software verification and validation techniques, such as procedural
audits, formal methods, or model documentation, are the mechanisms used to
achieve this...

### [Generic points in a characteristic class for amenable group actions are closed in the Besicovitch pseudometric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26572v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Sejal Babel, Martha Łącka, Marcel Mroczek

We consider an action of a countable amenable group on a compact metric
space, focusing on the set of generic points with respect to a fixed F{\o}lner
sequence. For a given characteristic class, we prove that the set of points
that are generic (along the F{\o}lner sequence) for some measure in this class
is closed with respect to the Besicovitch pseudometric....

### [AdSum: Two-stream Audio-visual Summarization for Automated Video Advertisement Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26569v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Wen Xie, Yanjun Zhu, Gijs Overgoor, Yakov Bart, Agata Lapedriza Garcia, Sarah Ostadabbas

Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We...

### [On the closedness of ergodic measures in a characteristic class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26564v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Sejal Babel, Martha Łącka

We endow the set of all invariant measures of a topological dynamical system
with a metric $\bar{\rho}$, which induces a topology stronger than the the
weak$^*$-topology. Then, we study the closedness of ergodic measures within a
characteristic class under this metric. Specifically, we show that if a
sequence of generic points associated with ergodic measures from a fixed
characteristic class conv...

### [On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Nikita Tsoy, Nikola Konstantinov

Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcu...

### [Tunable Colloidal Synthesis Enabling μ-ARPES on Individual Two-dimensional Bismuth Nanocrystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26558v1)
*Published: 2025-10-30*  
**Authors:** Fagui He, Yan Yan Grisan Qiu, Simone Mearini, Vitaliy Feyer, Kevin Oldenburg, Rostyslav Lesyuk, Christian Klinke

Two-dimensional bismuth (Bi) is a promising platform for quantum and energy
technologies due to strong spin-orbit coupling, high thermoelectric efficiency,
and magnetoresistance. However, scalable and flexible synthesis of high-quality
Bi with fast research turnaround remains challenging. We report a controlled
colloidal synthesis of Bi nanosheets with tunable lateral sizes (0.6 - 4.1 um),
hexagon...
