### [Type II embeddings for $d=6$ Einstein-Maxwell gauged supergravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02835v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Niall T. Macpherson, Ricardo Stuardo

Bi-spinor and G-structure methods are used to classify the possible consistent truncations of type II supergravity to $d=6$ Einstein-Maxwell (gauged) supergravity, and its consistent sub-sectors. In the absence of R-symmetry gauging and a tensor multiplet we establish that every supersymmetric Mink$_6$ solution defines an embedding of the $d=6$ theory. Adding a tensor multiplet places restrictions...

### [In Good GRACEs: Principled Teacher Selection for Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02833v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Abhishek Panigrahi, Bingbin Liu, Sadhika Malladi, Sham Kakade, Surbhi Goel

Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model. GRACE measures dist...

### [GeoCrossBench: Cross-Band Generalization for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02831v1)

Here we present Kosmos, an AI scientist tha...

### [Fortifying Distribution Network Nodes Subject to Network-Based Disruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02820v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Pelin Keşrit, Bahar Çavdar, Joseph Geunes

We consider a distribution network for delivering a natural resource or physical good to a set of nodes, each of which serves a set of customers, in which disruptions may occur at one or more nodes. Each node receives flow through a path from a source node, implying that the service at a node is interrupted if one or more nodes on the path from a source node experience a disruption. All network no...

### [From thermal to magnetic driving: spectral diagnostics of simulation-based magnetothermal disc wind models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02811v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*

Disc winds driven by thermal and magnetic processes are thought to play a critical role in protoplanetary disc evolution. However, the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain, particularly in light of their observational signatures. We investigate whether spatially resolved emission and synthetic spectral line profiles can distinguish between thermally and magnetically driven win...

### [Topologically Quantized Soliton-Like Pumping using Synthetic Nonlinearity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02806v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Ankitkumar Maisuriya, Siddhi Mali, Sunil Mittal

The interplay between nonlinear and topological physics has led to intriguing emergent phenomena, such as quantized and fractionally quantized Thouless pumping of solitons dictated by the topological invariants of the underlying band structure. Unlike linear Thouless pumping, which requires excitation of a Wannier function of a uniformly filled band, quantized soliton pumping is observed even with...

### [MemSearcher: Training LLMs to Reason, Search and Manage Memory via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02805v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Qianhao Yuan, Jie Lou, Zichao Li, Jiawei Chen, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Le Sun, Debing Zhang, Xianpei Han

Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemS...

### [Optimal Source Coding of Markov Chains for Real-Time Remote Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02803v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Ismail Cosandal, Sennur Ulukus

We revisit the source coding problem for a Markov chain under the assumption that the transmission times and how fast the Markov chain transitions its state happen at the same time-scale. Specifically, we assume that the transmission of each bit takes a single time slot, and the Markov chain updates its state in the same time slot. Thus, the length of the codeword assigned to a symbol determines t...

### [Cesam2k20: A code for a new generation of stellar evolution models. I. Description of the code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02801v1)

Over the last three decades, it has undergone many improvements and has been extensively tested against other stellar evolution codes before being selected to compute the first-generation grid of stellar models for the PLATO mission. Among all the development...

### [On the origin of exponential operator growth in Hilbert space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02800v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Vijay Ganesh Sadhasivam, Jan M. Rost, Stuart C. Althorpe

By analysing the growth of Krylov complexity for some simple models, we find that the exponential growth of an operator in Hilbert space can be predicted from the off-diagonal decay of the operator matrix elements in the system eigenbasis. When the decay is exponential or slower, the Krylov complexity grows exponentially; when it is algebraic or slower, the growth rate is maximal. As a result, non...

### [Intercomparison of a High-Resolution Regional Climate Model Ensemble for Catchment-Scale Water Cycle Processes under Human Influence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02799v1)

Large-scale data has driven breakthroughs in robotics, from language models to vision-language-action models in bimanual manipulation. However, humanoid robotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid teleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive motion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid teleoperation and ...

### [Densemarks: Learning Canonical Embeddings for Human Heads Images via Point Tracks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02830v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Dmitrii Pozdeev, Alexey Artemov, Ananta R. Bhattarai, Artem Sevastopolsky

We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads, enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches, estimated by a state-of...

### [PLUTO-4: Frontier Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02826v2)

### [Optimizing AI Agent Attacks With Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02823v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Chloe Loughridge, Paul Colognese, Avery Griffin, Tyler Tracy, Jon Kutasov, Joe Benton

As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to optimize attack policies in...

### [Fortifying Distribution Network Nodes Subject to Network-Based Disruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02820v1)

### [Improved lower bounds for the maximum order of an induced acyclic subgraph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02819v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Shamil Asgarli, Donald Falkenhagen, Kaya Hoshi

Computing the cardinality of a maximum induced acyclic vertex set in a digraph is NP-hard. Since finding an exact solution is computationally difficult, a fruitful approach is to establish high-quality lower bounds that are efficiently computable. We build on the Akbari--Ghodrati--Jabalameli--Saghafian (AGJS) bound for digraphs by adapting refinement techniques used by (a) Selkow and Harant--Mohr ...

### [Oolong: Evaluating Long Context Reasoning and Aggregation Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02817v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Amanda Bertsch, Adithya Pratapa, Teruko Mitamura, Graham Neubig, Matthew R. Gormley

As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context, which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This represents only one...

### [A Construction of Infinite Families of Self-Orthogonal Quasi-Cyclic Codes Using Constituent Codes.pdf](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02813v1)
*Published: 2025-11-04*  
**Authors:** Gustavo Terra Bastos, Angelynn Álvarez, Cameron Williams

Quasi-cyclic codes have been recently employed in the constructions of quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we propose a construction of infinite families of quasi-cyclic codes which are self-orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products. In particular, their dimension and a lower bound for their minimum distance are computed using their constituent codes defined ...

We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs). While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that subtraction a...
