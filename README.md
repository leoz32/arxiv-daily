We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen), streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences), implicit 3D spa...

### [Quantum Search With Generalized Wildcards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04669v1)
*Published: 2025-11-06*  
**Authors:** Arjan Cornelissen, Nikhil S. Mande, Subhasree Patro, Nithish Raja, Swagato Sanyal

In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs...

### [SIMS-V: Simulated Instruction-Tuning for Spatial Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04668v1)
*Published: 2025-11-06*

*Published: 2025-11-06*  
**Authors:** Ben Sanati, Thomas L. Lee, Trevor McInroe, Aidan Scannell, Nikolay Malkin, David Abel, Amos Storkey

A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic theory that char...

### [Intermittency in Collisionless Large-Amplitude Turbulence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04663v1)
*Published: 2025-11-06*  
**Authors:** Ryan Golant, Luca Comisso, Philipp Kempski, Lorenzo Sironi

Large-amplitude turbulence -- characterized by a fluctuating magnetic field component, $\delta B$, that is stronger than the mean component, $B_0$ -- is generically intermittent, populated with intense localized structures such as sharp field-line bends and rapid field reversals. Recent MHD simulations suggest that these structures play an important role in particle transport and acceleration; how...

### [$\texttt{unimpeded}$: A Public Grid of Nested Sampling Chains for Cosmological Model Comparison and Tension Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04661v1)

To address this, we release $\texttt{unimpeded}$, a publicly available Python library and data repository providing pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC chains. We apply this resource to conduct a systematic analysis across a gri...

### [Finite time blow-up for a multi-dimensional model of the Kiselev-Sarsam equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04660v1)
*Published: 2025-11-06*  
**Authors:** Wanwan Zhang

In this paper, we propose and study a multi-dimensional nonlocal active scalar equation of the form \begin{eqnarray*} \partial_t\rho+g\mathcal{R}_a\rho\cdot \nabla\rho= 0,~\rho(\cdot,0)=\rho_{0}, \end{eqnarray*} where the transform $\mathcal{R}_a$ is defined by \begin{eqnarray*} \mathcal{R}_af(x)=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}{\pi^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}P.V.\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^n}\Big(\frac{x-y}{|x-y|^{...

### [Photodetection of Squeezed Light: a Whittaker-Shannon Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04657v1)
*Published: 2025-11-06*  
**Authors:** Jasper Kranias, Christian Drago, Colin Vendromin, J. E. Sipe

The Whittaker-Shannon decomposition provides a temporally localized description of squeezed light, making it applicable in the CW limit and leading to a definition of squeezing strength based on the number of photon pairs at a time. We show examples of its usefulness by calculating quadrature variance in a homodyne detection scheme, coincidence detection probabilities in the continuous-wave limit,...

### [Arithmetic Geometric Model for the Renormalisation of Bi-critical Irrationally Indifferent Attractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04656v1)
*Published: 2025-11-06*  
**Authors:** Jocelyn Finbar Russell

In this paper we introduce an entirely new toy model for the dynamical system generated by the post-critical set of a special class of "bi-critical" holomorphic maps. These maps have an irrationally indifferent fixed point together with two critical points that "interact" in a non-trivial way. The model depends entirely on the arithmetic features of a special pair of numbers. This study has genera...

### [Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic for Efficient Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04654v1)
*Published: 2025-11-06*

**Authors:** Maximus A. Pace, Prithwish Dan, Chuanruo Ning, Atiksh Bhardwaj, Audrey Du, Edward W. Duan, Wei-Chiu Ma, Kushal Kedia

Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences, human demonstra...

Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which represent only geometric p...

### [VeriCoT: Neuro-symbolic Chain-of-Thought Validation via Logical Consistency Checks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662v1)
*Published: 2025-11-06*  
**Authors:** Yu Feng, Nathaniel Weir, Kaj Bostrom, Sam Bayless, Darion Cassel, Sapana Chaudhary, Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter, Huzefa Rangwala

LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalize...

Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic principle for benchma...
