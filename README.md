letter multiplicities and Hamiltonian paths in complete $m$-partite graphs
$K_{n,n,\ldots,n}$. This bijection allows us to derive closed
inclusion-exclusion formulas for the number of Hamiltonian cycles in such
graphs. We further extend the enumeration to the generalized nonuniform case
$K_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_m}$. We also pr...\n\n### [Localization and anomalous reference frames in gravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26589v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Laurent Freidel, Josh Kirklin\n\nIn this work, we study the classical phase space for the gravitational
degrees of freedom along a null ray. We construct gauge-invariant observables
localized on a null ray segment that commute with those localized on the
complement; thus, the phase space describes a genuine gravitational subsystem
compatible with both locality and diffeomorphism invariance. Our construction
employs 'dressing time...\n\n### [Tensor decomposition beyond uniqueness, with an application to the minrank problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26587v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Pascal Koiran, Rafael Oliveira\n\nWe prove a generalization to Jennrich's uniqueness theorem for tensor
decompositions in the undercomplete setting. Our uniqueness theorem is based on
an alternative definition of the standard tensor decomposition, which we call
matrix-vector decomposition. Moreover, in the same settings in which our
uniqueness theorem applies, we also design and analyze an efficient randomized
algorithm to compute...\n\n### [Stop Wasting Your Tokens: Towards Efficient Runtime Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26585v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Fulin Lin, Shaowen Chen, Ruishan Fang, Hongwei Wang, Tao Lin\n\nWhile Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing
autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,
such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.
Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking
proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To
this end, we introduce Su...\n\n### [Emu3.5: Native Multimodal Models are World Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26583v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Yufeng Cui, Honghao Chen, Haoge Deng, Xu Huang, Xinghang Li, Jirong Liu, Yang Liu, Zhuoyan Luo, Jinsheng Wang, Wenxuan Wang, Yueze Wang, Chengyuan Wang, Fan Zhang, Yingli Zhao, Ting Pan, Xianduo Li, Zecheng Hao, Wenxuan Ma, Zhuo Chen, Yulong Ao, Tiejun Huang, Zhongyuan Wang, Xinlong Wang\n\nWe introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively

end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interle...\n\n### [CATCH: A Modular Cross-domain Adaptive Template with Hook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26582v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Xinjin Li, Yulie Lu, Jinghan Cao, Yu Ma, Zhenglin Li, Yeyang Zhou\n\nRecent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts an...\n\n### [Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning Using Vision-Language Alignment in Zero-Shot Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26580v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Manjunath Prasad Holenarasipura Rajiv, B. M. Vidyavathi\n\nIn real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios

space, focusing on the set of generic points with respect to a fixed F{\o}lner
sequence. For a given characteristic class, we prove that the set of points
that are generic (along the F{\o}lner sequence) for some measure in this class
is closed with respect to the Besicovitch pseudometric....\n\n### [AdSum: Two-stream Audio-visual Summarization for Automated Video Advertisement Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26569v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Wen Xie, Yanjun Zhu, Gijs Overgoor, Yakov Bart, Agata Lapedriza Garcia, Sarah Ostadabbas\n\nAdvertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We...\n\n### [On the closedness of ergodic measures in a characteristic class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26564v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Sejal Babel, Martha Łącka\n\nWe endow the set of all invariant measures of a topological dynamical system
with a metric $\bar{\rho}$, which induces a topology stronger than the the
weak$^*$-topology. Then, we study the closedness of ergodic measures within a
characteristic class under this metric. Specifically, we show that if a

characteristic class conv...\n\n### [On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Nikita Tsoy, Nikola Konstantinov\n\nShortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcu...\n\n### [Tunable Colloidal Synthesis Enabling μ-ARPES on Individual Two-dimensional Bismuth Nanocrystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26558v1)\n*Published: 2025-10-30*  \n**Authors:** Fagui He, Yan Yan Grisan Qiu, Simone Mearini, Vitaliy Feyer, Kevin Oldenburg, Rostyslav Lesyuk, Christian Klinke\n\nTwo-dimensional bismuth (Bi) is a promising platform for quantum and energy
